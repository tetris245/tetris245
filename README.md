# QAM

Quick-AccessMenu2.1 by Nemesea - Add-on for Ben987's BondageClub game 

Most recent release is version 1.11.0 - Visit also our wiki: https://github.com/tetris245/tetris245/wiki

## Important notice - Updated on 12/02/23

**After more than one year of QAM development, I've decided to make a long pause. Only some maintenance will be done in 2023.**

**It was for me a nice experience and many users have appreciated all the changes, improvements and additions made during this year. The next step would be to get full compatibility with other add-ons by using a ModSDK, created by the main BCX coder. However, I'm not an advanced coder, and it will take some time.**

**I hope that someone with better skills will create another mod with improved features. There will be a future for QAM, more info in Spring.**
