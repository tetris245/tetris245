## Important notice - Updated on 29/03/23

**After more than one year of intense QAM development, there will be only some maintenance for QAM in 2023. Version 1.12.00 is one of these maintenance versions.**

**It was for me a nice experience and many users have appreciated all the changes, improvements and additions made during the year 2022.**

**ULTRAbc is available, it's the the modSDK version of QAM, for a better compatibiity with other add-ons, especially BCX and FBC. At some point in the future, I will remove links and files for QAM bookmark and tmloader. All QAM users are invited to switch to ULTRAbc**
