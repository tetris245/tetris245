Most recent release is version 1.12.0- Visit also our wiki: https://github.com/tetris245/tetris245/wiki

## Important notice - Updated on 07/03/23

**After more than one year of intense QAM development, there will be only some maintenance for QAM in 2023. Version 1.12.00 is one of these maintenance versions.**

**It was for me a nice experience and many users have appreciated all the changes, improvements and additions made during the year 2022.**

**This month, I will release ULTRAbc 1.0.0, the modSDK version of QAM, for a better compatibiity with other add-ons, especially BCX and FBC. However, QAM will continue to exist, as I want to give full freedom of choice to the end-users**
